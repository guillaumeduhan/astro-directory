## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/astro-seo-directory-template.git
cd astro-seo-directory-template
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

The site will be available at [http://localhost:4321/](http://localhost:4321/).

## ✍️ Adding Content

Add your `.mdx` or `.md` files to the `src/content/` directory. Each file becomes a page accessible via its slug.

### Frontmatter Example

```yaml
---
title: "Entry Name"
description: "Brief description for SEO and social sharing"
tags: ["tech", "startup"]
image: "/images/example.png"
---
```

> 📝 **Note**: The `index.mdx` file is ignored in the sidebar.

## 🔍 Sidebar and Search

The sidebar automatically lists all `.mdx` files (excluding `index.mdx`). A search field allows real-time filtering of results.

## 🎨 Customization

- Modify `src/styles/global.css` to adjust global styles.
- Adjust the layout via `src/layouts/Layout.astro`.
- Customize components in `src/components/`.

## 📦 Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
pnpm build
```

The static site will be generated in the `dist/` directory.
