When it comes to building fast, SEO-friendly websites, the debate between **Static Rendering (SSG)** and **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** is still common. While SSR has its strengths for highly dynamic data, static rendering consistently delivers superior results for SEO.  

The reason? **Search engines prefer speed and predictability**. Pre-built HTML files generated with SSG are served instantly, without waiting for server processes. This means lower latency, faster load times, and a smoother experience for both users and crawlers.  

With **Astro**, developers can take full advantage of static rendering while still embedding islands of interactivity where needed. Instead of bloating every page with JavaScript, Astro keeps most pages **zero-JS by default**, ensuring Core Web Vitals are met with ease.  

In short, if SEO is your priority, static rendering provides the foundation for better rankings, faster indexing, and reduced infrastructure costs — without sacrificing modern user experiences.
