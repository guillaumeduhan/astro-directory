Search engines now rely heavily on **Core Web Vitals** — metrics like **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**, **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**, and **First Input Delay (FID)** — to evaluate user experience. Static rendering has become one of the most effective ways to meet these standards.  

With **SSG**, content is generated at build time and delivered instantly, minimizing server wait times. This ensures **low LCP** and fast visual rendering. Since static pages are predictable, **CLS is reduced**, avoiding layout jumps caused by late-loading scripts. And because Astro minimizes JavaScript by default, **FID is naturally lower**, creating snappy interactions.  

AstroDirectory.dev demonstrates this perfectly: pre-rendered content, clean slugs, and optimized metadata combine to create pages that score higher in SEO audits and Google Lighthouse reports.  

For anyone serious about SEO, static rendering isn’t just an option — it’s the new baseline for success.
