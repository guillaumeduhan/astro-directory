## How Content Works

Content lives in the `src/content` folder and can be authored in `.mdx` or `.md`. Each file becomes a page automatically. Use frontmatter to add:

```yaml
---
title: "Example Listing"
description: "Short description for SEO and social sharing"
tags: ["tech", "startup"]
image: "/images/example.png"
---
```

## Styling and Layouts
Includes:
- Tailwind CSS
- Dark mode toggle
- Global layout wrapper
- Responsive layout (mobile → desktop)
- Customize the look easily

## Dynamic Pages & Routing
Use dynamic routes like [slug].astro to render MDX files as pages. No need for a CMS. You can:
- Create pages manually
- Fetch slugs from the filesystem
- Pre-render everything at build time
- Dynamic routing will create automatically your pages

## Ideal Use Cases
This template is perfect for:

- Link directories
- Job boards
- Local business listings
- Personal collections
- Resource hubs
- Curated directories

## Performance & Hosting
Built with Astro for fast static output

- 100 Lighthouse scores out of the box
- Host anywhere (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
- Deploy your site in minutes

## FAQs
### Is Astro better than Next.js for directories?
If SEO, speed, and simplicity are your goals: yes. Astro ships zero JS by default and works great with Markdown/MDX.

### Do I need a database or CMS?
Nope. Just edit .mdx or .md files and commit them. The site updates at build time.

### Can I add a search feature?
Yes! Integrate with Algolia, Fuse.js, or custom solutions easily thanks to the static output.

### Can I monetize my directory?
Absolutely. Add Stripe, Gumroad, job post fees, affiliate links, or newsletter sponsorships.
