For e-commerce websites, every second matters. Studies show that a **1-second delay in page load time can reduce conversions by up to 7%**. That’s why more online stores are turning to **Static Rendering (SSG)** to boost both **SEO rankings** and **sales performance**.  

Unlike dynamic platforms that rebuild pages on each request, static sites pre-generate HTML at build time. The result: **ultra-fast product pages** that search engines can crawl instantly, giving your catalog better visibility in SERPs. Faster loading also means lower bounce rates and higher engagement — two factors that directly influence SEO.  

With **Astro**, product listings and category pages can be rendered statically while still supporting **client-side interactivity** like shopping carts or filters. This hybrid approach ensures customers enjoy modern e-commerce experiences without sacrificing speed.  

In short, static rendering isn’t just about rankings. It’s about **trust, conversions, and growth**. For any store that wants to scale SEO and revenue at the same time, SSG is a true game-changer.
